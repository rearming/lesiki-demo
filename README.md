# Lesiki Demo App (Лесики)

Code from unity project that I'm doing for child educational startup demo. 
Full project isn't available now because of assets copyrights. 

The project is based on original fairy tails about forest kids (Lesiki) and their adventures. \
After each episode child is asked questions about storie's content. I'm using speech recognition to detect correct answers.

In the project I've implemented storytelling and questions-asking engine. \
Also, I've done statistics tracking so that parents can watch and track child's progress, inspect his falures and achivements.
